## 🗂️ Highlight Projects

- [**Zomato Food Chatbot**](https://github.com/ShrutiChrist/Zomato-FoodChatbot-Major-Project):I am here to equip you with a practical guide, one that you can easily follow and implement. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and integrating an end-to-end NLP chatbot with a website, empowering you to take on this task with confidence. 
I am dividing my video into three series covering all essential aspects, including the Business Perspective. This post is my first video series, which is covered below💻🗣️

**Introduction:**  We first configure our Chatbot in DialogFlow and then write a back-end server in Python using a fast API web-serving framework. And this will finally interact with MYSQL DATABASE. We will be placing and retrieving orders from my SQL database. Then, we will integrate our Chatbot with an interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 📝

**Problem Statement:** A few weeks ago, I was craving food from Zomato, a popular food delivery website, but I have a specific question about the menu. Wouldn't it be convenient if this website had a customer chatbot that could provide instant answers? That's the problem we're going to solve together. 🍔🍕


**Scope of Work:** It is essential, as we will focus on implementing important features. Let's understand the importance of our chosen features from a business perspective. The decision to select a vital feature is based on two factors: first, the feature's crucial role in our Chatbot's functionality, and second, its feasibility impact analysis, ensuring you're well-informed about your strategic choices. So, we had to scope our work to new orders, track orders, and offer/store hours 🌐🤝

**Using ChatGPT for Solution Design & Architecture:** We are using ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, to enhance the conversational capabilities of our Chatbot. This technology will be crucial in understanding and generating natural language responses, making our Chatbot more interactive and user-friendly.🚀🔥
